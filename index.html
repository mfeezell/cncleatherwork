	<h2>Welcome to CNC Leatherwork</h2>
<p>
	I started working with leather because I wanted a simple, well-made handbag without any logos or other ornamentation on it.  It seemed like a simple request, but logo-free leather goods are surprisingly hard to find.  So, I decided to make my own.  Leatherwork isn’t rocket science, and I’ve been a lifelong craftsperson. How hard could it be? <br><br>

Pretty hard, as it turns out. Accomplished leatherworkers have honed their craft with years of practice. I was willing to put in some work, but I didn’t want to wait years before I turned out something decent.  Luckily, I belonged to a makerspace, and I knew other makers were using laser cutters to cut leather.  After talking with them and running a few tests, I realized that I could fake years of craftsmanship if I could also cut in the stitch holes at regular intervals.<br><br>

Is it a cheat?  If developing strong leatherworking skills is your goal, then yes.  If you just want a well-made leather handbag without any tchotchkes, though - or a well-made leather anything - this is a fast way to get there. <br><br>

The projects that I've created, along with the resouces that I relied on to created them, are collected on these pages.  Take a look around, and feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any questions or suggestions.

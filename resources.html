	Like most hobbies, leatherwork can be as modest or expensive as your budget allows. Fortunately, basic leatherworking tools and supplies aren't terribly expensive, and you don't need many of them. Laser cutters are a different story, but hopefully you can find a local maker space or school facility that has one.<br><br>
	The suppliers that I use, along with my current research on laser cutters and some inspiration are in the links below.<br><br>
